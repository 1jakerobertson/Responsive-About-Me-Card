# Responsive-About-Me-Card
This is a mini project built in HTML and CSS. It is a responsive about me card with an transparent modern box design.

The purpose of the project was to practice HTML and CSS skills! I'm having a lot of fun just building pages and websites. When I feel comfortable, I will start to incoporate JavaScript in my projects.
